// API stands for Application Programming Interface
//   useful for communication between different software systems by 
//   facilitating data exchange (using requests and responses) between 
//   systems located in different remote places.

// An API endpoint is the touchpoint of communication to an API that is interacting
//   with another system. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access
//   the resources they need to carry out their function.
